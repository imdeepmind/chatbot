i would say just a coincidence it would seem weird for a death to mention a minor moment in a podcastalso considering that podcast came out over a year ago that makes it more unlikely,this gavin probably said tripping because he might have remembered that he once bruised his brain or something from falling over and was blind for a few days relevant rtaa

if only monocorp sells x then you have two options1 monocorp is selling x at a good enough price and quality therefore you do not have competition how is this bad if no entrepreneur successfully competes against monocorp that means no entrepreneur thinks it can produce a better product than monocorp it is as good as it gets rejoice2 monopoly corp is selling x at a price and quality that people complain about therefore an entrepreneur starts a competitor monopoly no more if the competitor fails see 1 if it succeeds monopoly no more forever,a falacy that might come up what if monopoly corp uses the money it earns to buy up the starting competitorthen it is creating more incentives for more and more new competitors of course that defeats the purpose of the monopolist

the power of esports is too strong for them to resist i guess,everyone has a price
i would be inclined to buy it if they did hopefully the price will not be as expensive as it is now base price is still 60f2p would also be nice but it would probably lead to worse design issues in the game b2p may be a better revenue model we will see,the game is well worth 60 if they go b2p
